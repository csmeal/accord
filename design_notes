Need to start with a very basic UI, simply for showing that the system works.
Then we need to add a simple support for two players in one game (run frontend from two different browsers?)
Next, need to add very simply actions for the player to perform (end turn, play minion, attack minion with other minion)
As we do that, add in backend logic for each of those actions (gain a mana and card each turn).
Then start adding in game logic (game starts, game ends with death, creatures can go face, etc.)
Then add an actual web server, to host the game lobby, and add lobby logic.
Add more complex and generic card features (battlecry, deathrattle, static effects, summoning sickness, draw, damage, heal, etc.)
Move it all to the cloud.
Make boards generic (rules for adding beginning of turn effects are generic)
Alpha complete.
